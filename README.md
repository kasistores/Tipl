## Notes

Originally getting used to writing the PHP in the middle of all of the html was definitely a learning experience at first and I am still trying to get over all of the quirks and difficulties of using google's materialize api and how the whole grid system works. Currently can't figure out how to have a text field as an option connected to a radio button instead of a normal label and how to change the number of people to split the bill amongst in real time without having to do any submissions. I think that may be more javascript than php.
